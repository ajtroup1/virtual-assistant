SAM v2 capabilities:

indicate a message is intended for sam: "sam, {message}"

After 'sam' is included, use references to structure your command:

Voice "sam, say {message}":
	says anything on command

Web Navigation "sam, navigate to {name of website}":
	no need to include https or .com
	if you navigate to a search engine like google, you can also append "... and search {message}"
		"sam, navigate to google and search dog toys"
